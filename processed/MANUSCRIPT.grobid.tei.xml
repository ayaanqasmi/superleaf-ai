<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mutualistic cooperative ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) have been proposed to improve the spectrum and energy efficiencies of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, where a primary link (from a primary transmitter to a primary receiver) and an AmBC link (from an IoT device to the same primary receiver) form a mutualism relationship. We note that hardware impairments (HIs), which are unavoidable in practical systems and may significantly affect the transmission rates of the primary and AmBC links and their mutualism relationships, have been largely ignored in the study of mutualistic cooperative AmBC networks. In this paper, we study a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network with HIs at all the active transceivers and a non-linear energy harvesting circuit at each IoT device. We derive closed-form rate expressions for both the AmBC and primary links and theoretically prove that the mutualism relationship between the AmBC and primary links is maintained under HIs, i.e., the rate of the primary link in the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network is still higher than that without the AmBC link. To maximize the weighted sum rate of all links in a cooperative AmBC network under HIs, we propose two resource allocation schemes for two scenarios with a single link and multiple AmBC links, respectively. For the single AmBC link case, we derive the optimal transmit power of the primary transmitter and the optimal power reflection coefficient of the IoT device in closed forms. For the scenario with multiple AmBC links, the weighted-sum-rate maximization problem is transformed into Part of this work has been accepted by the IEEE ICC <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>L ARGE-SCALE Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments are facing challenges due to the limited battery capacity of devices and scarce spectrum resources. Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) have been proposed as a spectrum-and energy-efficient solution for</p><p>IoT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The basic principle of AmBC is to allow an IoT device to adjust its the antenna's load impedance to passively modulate information on the incident signals and backscatter the modulated signals to the associated receiver, while harvesting energy from the incident signals to support its circuit operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. AmBC has been validated by various practical prototypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The transmission rate of an AmBC link is limited by the co-channel interference, because the AmBC receiver receives both the primary transmitter's (PT's) and AmBC transmitter's<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> signals simultaneously and the PT's signal is usually much stronger than that of AmBC. Meanwhile, due to the non-cooperative spectrum sharing between the primary link and the AmBC link, it is hard for the AmBC receiver to obtain the channel state information of each link, hence cannot remove the severe co-channel interference caused by the PT's signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. To address this problem, one way is to enable certain forms of cooperation at the AmBC receiver to remove the co-channel interference from the PT by designing sophisticated symbol detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Another way to overcome the above challenge is to design novel cooperative AmBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>,</p><p>where the primary link and the AmBC link are jointly designed to remove or suppress the cochannel interference. Depending on whether the AmBC modulation rate is equal to or much slower than that of PT, cooperative AmBC can be classified into parasitic cooperative AmBC and mutualistic cooperative AmBC. In the former, the AmBC receiver firstly decodes the PT's signal while treating the interference from the AmBC link as noise and then removes the decoded PT signal from the composite received signal to decode the AmBC signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In the latter, as the AmBC modulation rate is much slower than that of the PT and the received AmBC signal includes both the PT's and the IoT device's information, the AmBC link can provide an additional multipath gain for the primary receiver to decode the PT's signal, forming a mutualism relationship between the primary and AmBC links <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, the authors maximized the weighted sum rate of both the primary and AmBC links by jointly optimizing the PT's transmit power and beamforming vectors in parasitic and mutualistic cooperative AmBC networks, respectively. The similar optimizations were also studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> by considering the finite block length in AmBC links. The authors of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> formulated a stochastic optimization to maximize the utility function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the PT's transmit beamforming and its associated receiver's beamforming.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, the authors considered a parasitic cooperative AmBC network with a full-duplex IoT device, where the IoT device splits the incident signal into two parts for message decoding and passive transmission simultaneously, and the PT's transmit power was minimized by jointly optimizing the PT's beamforming vectors and the IoT device's power splitting ratio. Considering the energy-causality constraint at each IoT device, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> jointly optimized the PT's transmit power and the IoT device's power reflection coefficient and backscattering time to maximize the energy efficiency in parasitic and mutualistic cooperative AmBC networks, respectively. In addition to the above works <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> with a focus on resource allocation, performance evaluation was also studied in cooperative AmBC networks. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the outage probability and the diversity gain of a parasitic cooperative AmBC network were derived.</p><p>Combining parasitic cooperative AmBC with downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), the outage probability and the ergodic capacity were analyzed theoretically in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Considering a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network, the authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> derived the upper bounds of the ergodic capacity for both the primary and AmBC links.</p><p>In the above works <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the radio frequency (RF) front ends of each transceiver are assumed to be ideal, and it has been shown that the AmBC link can offer beneficial multipath diversity to the primary link and thus the primary link achieves a higher transmission rate than the case without the AmBC link, i.e., there is a mutualism relationship between the primary and AmBC links <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Nevertheless, in practical communications, RF front ends are susceptible to a variety of hardware impairments (HIs), e.g., in-phase/quadrature imbalance, quantization error, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The HIs will distort the signals generated by the transmitter and thus degrade the information decoding performance at the receiver. In spite of the efforts on the development of mitigation algorithms, there always exist residual HIs due to the time-varying hardware characteristics. Although in a very recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the authors derived the expressions for both the outage probability and intercept probability in a parasitic cooperative NOMA-AmBC network, where the RF front ends of all transceivers suffer HIs, the impacts of HIs on the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network are still unknown. In the presence of HIs, the AmBC link not only brings an additional multipath diversity gain but also backscatters the distortion noises caused by HIs at the PT's front ends to the primary link. In this regard, the following question arises: does the mutualism relationship between the primary and AmBC links still exist in the presence of HIs? Moreover, the resource allocation for cooperative AmBC networks under HIs has not been studied.</p><p>In this work, we study the impact of HIs on a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network, where an IoT device modulates its information on the incident signal transmitted by the PT with a much slower symbol rate than that of PT while harvesting energy from the PT's signal for sustaining its operation, and design resource allocation schemes to maximize the weighted sum rate of the primary and AmBC links under HIs. A non-linear energy harvesting model is considered for each IoT device as it better reflects the non-linear properties of energy harvesting circuits. The main contributions are summarized as follows.</p><p>• We theoretically prove the following three results to reveal the impacts of HIs on the achievable rates of the primary link and the AmBC link. First, the rate of each link under HIs is strictly lower than that without HIs. Second, under given HIs, the primary link's rate in the considered mutualistic cooperative AmBC network is strictly higher than that without any spectrum-sharing AmBC link. Third, the HIs lead to the rate ceilings for the primary and AmBC links. The first two results validate that the existence of HIs degrades the rate of both the AmBC and primary links but does not destroy the mutualism relationship between them. Compared with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, our conclusion 2 is more rigorous and the details are summarized in Remark 2. In the third result, we derive the upper-bound rate of the primary link and that of the AmBC link at a very high transmit power of the PT. Besides, we derive a closed-form expression of the primary link's rate under the assumption that the modulated information of the IoT device follows a symmetric complex Gaussian distribution.</p><p>• We design resource allocation schemes to maximize the weighted sum rate in mutualistic cooperative AmBC networks with a single AmBC link or multiple AmBC links, while considering HIs. For the case with a single AmBC link, we derive the optimal power reflection coefficient of the IoT device and the optimal transmit power of the PT that maximize the weighted sum rate of the primary and AmBC links, subject to the energycausality constraint of the IoT device. For the case with multiple AmBC links, we formulate a non-convex problem to maximize the weighted sum rate of all links by jointly optimizing the power reflection coefficient and backscattering time of each IoT device and the transmit power of the PT. By exploiting the monotonicity of the primary link's rate and the AmBC link's rate and constructing auxiliary variables, the original problem is transformed into a more tractable form, the convexity of which depends on the energy harvesting model considered for each IoT device. By introducing a non-linear but convex energy harvesting model, the transformed problem is shown to be convex and solved by the convex tools.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model and the rate of the primary and AmBC links under HIs are presented. Sections III studies the impacts of HIs on the mutualism relationship between the primary and AmBC links, and derives the closed-form rate expressions for both the primary and AmBC links. In Section IV, two resource allocation schemes are developed to maximize the weighted sum rate. Simulation results are provided in Section V and Section VI draws the main conclusion. 2 The ideal hardware in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a special case of our considered model, thus the conclusion that the mutualism relationship between the AmBC and primary link exists is also valid for the ideal case. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. SYSTEM MODEL AND RATE ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we first introduce the system model and the associated assumptions, and then analyze the rate of the primary and AmBC links in the presence of HIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. System Model and Assumption</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network that consists of one PT, one primary receiver (PR), and one IoT device (also referred to as a backscatter device (BD) hereafter). Both PT and PR are non-energy-constrained transceivers that are composed of active components, e.g., oscillators, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters. Each BD consists of a backscatter circuit and an energy harvesting circuit. The channel power gains of the PT-BD link, the PT-PR link (also termed as the primary link), and the BD-PR link (also termed as the AmBC link) are denoted by h, f , g, respectively. A block-fading channel model is considered, i.e., all the channel power gains stay constant within each transmission block but may change across different transmission blocks. To obtain the performance bound of both primary and AmBC links, we assume perfect channel state information (CSI) and the details on how to obtain CSI can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Relaxing this assumption makes our considered network close to practical scenarios, which is a new challenge and can be studied in the future.</p><p>Let x p (n) and c s (i) denote the primary signal in the n-th symbol period and the AmBC signal in the i-th symbol period, respectively. Due to the simple backscatter circuit in the BD and the low modulation rate of the BD, the symbol period of x p (n), denoted by T p , is shorter than that of c s (i), denoted by T c . For analytical tractability, we assume that T c = LT p , where L 1 is a positive integer, and that x p (n) follows an independent circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution, i.e., x p (n) ∼ CN (0, 1). Also, the mean and variance of c s (i) are assumed to be zero and one, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Rate Analysis Considering HIs</head><p>In the considered network, PT and BD work in the cooperative mode and transmit their information to the PR by sharing the same resource block. More specifically, BD modulates its own information on the incident signal transmitted by the PT and reflects the modulated signal to the PR, while harvesting energy to sustain its backscatter operation by varying the power reflection coefficient β. Accordingly, the signal transmitted by the PT and the incident signal arriving at the BD can be written as, respectively 3 ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y PT (n) = x p (n) + τ p (n),<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">y BD (n) = √ h (x p (n) + τ p (n)) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where τ p (n) is the distortion noise caused by HIs of the PT. τ p (n) follows an independent zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution, and its variance is the product of the average power of the PT's signal P 0 and the square of HI level parameter κ p <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, i.e., τ p (n) ∼ CN 0, κ 2 p P 0 . Through a power reflection coefficient β, the received signal y BD (n) is split into two parts: one is used as the carrier for modulating and backscattering information 4 c s (i) to the PR, while the other is harvested for powering its backscatter circuit. Accordingly, the received signal of the PR and the harvested power of the BD can be expressed as, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">y PR (n) = βhg (x p (n) + τ p (n)) c s (i) PT→BD→PR link + f (x p (n) + τ p (n)) PT→PR link +τ r (n) + w (n) ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>3 Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, here we omit the thermal noise at the BD as its power introduced by the passive components is much smaller than that of h (xp(n) + τp(n)). 4 The BD adjusts its antenna's load impedance to passively modulate information cs (i) on the incident signal yBD(n) and backscatter the modulated signal to the PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which avoids the imperfect RF components. Thus, there is no distortion noise introduced by the BD.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E BD = ϕ (1 -β) hP 0 1 + κ 2 p ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where w (n) is the additive complex white Gaussian noise with mean zero and variance σ 2 , ϕ (•) is a non-decreasing function to reflect the relationship between the input power and the harvested power for a practical energy harvester, τ r (n) is the hardware distortion noise, and follows the Gaussian distribution with a zero mean and a variance that equals the product of the average power of the incident signal and the square of the HI level parameter κ r <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For given c s (i), the average power of the incident signal in a symbol period is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P 0 1 + κ 2 p hβg|c s (i)| 2 + f ,</formula><p>while the average power of the incident signal in a transmission block, which is much longer than a symbol period of the BD, is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P 0 1 + κ 2 p hβgE |c s (i)| 2 + f = κ 2 r P 0 1 + κ 2 p (hβg + f ), where E |c s (i)| 2 = 1.</formula><p>Accordingly, the distribution of τ r (n) can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">τ r (n) ∼    CN 0, κ 2 r P 0 1 + κ 2 p hβg|c s (i)| 2 + f , within one BD symbol period CN 0, κ 2 r P 0 1 + κ 2 p (hβg + f ) , within one transmission block .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>As T c = LT p , c s (i) spans L primary symbol periods for n = 1, 2, ..., L, i.e., c s (i) keeps almost unchanged for decoding x p (n), n = 1, 2, ..., L. For a given c s (i), the first term in (3) can be rewritten as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">√ βhgx p (n)c s (i) + √ βhgτ p (n)c s (i), where √ βhgx p (n)c s (i) and √ βhgτ p (n)c s (i)</formula><p>can be regarded as the output of the PT signal x p (n) passing through a slowly varying channel √ βhgc s (i) and the Gaussian noise with variance κ 2 p P 0 βhg|c s (i)| 2 . Accordingly, the SINR to decode x p (n) and the achievable rate of x p (n) within the symbol period of c s (i) can be calculated as, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">γ xp (c s (i)) = P 0 hβg|c s (i)| 2 + P 0 f P 0 hβg|c s (i)| 2 + f κ + σ 2 ,<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">R p (c s (i)) = B w log 2 1 + γ xp (c s (i)) ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where B w denotes the communication bandwidth, and κ=κ 2 r κ 2 p + κ 2 r + κ 2 p . By assuming that the number of symbols of the BD signal is sufficiently large within one transmission block, then the average rate of x p (n) within one transmission block can be derived as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C p = E cs(i) [R p (c s (i))] ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where E x [•] denotes the expectation operator over the random variable x.</p><p>After obtaining the rate of the primary link, we derive the rate of the AmBC link. We assume for simplicity that √ hf x p (n) can be perfectly removed from y PR (n) via successive interference cancellation (SIC). Thus, the remaining signal at the PR to decode c s (i) is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ŷPR (n) = βhg (x p (n) + τ p (n)) c s (i) + f τ p (n) + τ r (n) + w (n) .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>As the average power of x p (n) equals one and one BD symbol, e.g., c s (i), is modulated into the L consecutive PT symbol periods, x p (n), n = 1, 2, ..., L, the maximal ratio combing (MRC) can be performed on ŷPR (n), n = 1, 2, ..., L, which are received in L consecutive primary symbol periods, to decode c s (i). The resulting average SINR can be calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">γ cs = L n=1 E βhg|x p (n)| 2 |τ p (n)| 2 (βhg + f ) + |τ r (n)| 2 + |w (n)| 2 = LβhgP 0 P 0 (βhg + f ) κ + σ 2 ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where the second equality holds due to</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E[|x p (1)| 2 ] = E|x p (2)| 2 ] = ... = E[|x p (n)| 2 ] = P 0 , E[|τ p (1)| 2 ] = E[|τ p (2)| 2 ] = ... = E[|τ p (n)| 2 ] = κ 2 p P 0 , E[|τ r (1)| 2 ] = E[|τ r (2)| 2 ] = ... = E[|τ r (n)| 2 ] = κ 2 r P 0 1 + κ 2 p (hβg + f ), and E[|w (1)| 2 ] = E[|w (2)| 2 ] = ... = E[|w (n)| 2 ] = σ 2 .</formula><p>In the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network, as modulating one BD symbol requires L consecutive PT symbols, the PT's signal x p (n) can be viewed as a spread-spectrum code with length L for BD symbols. Accordingly, the SINR to decode c s (i) is increased by L times at the price of symbol rate decreased by 1 L , and the BD's rate can be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">C s = B w L log 2 (1 + γ cs ) .<label>(11)</label></formula></div>

Interestingly, the upper bound of C p only depends on the HIs, while for the AmBC link, its upper bound is jointly affected by the HIs and the channel power gains.

That is, the existence of HIs does not destroy the mutual benefit between the AmBC and primary links. In particular, letting κ p = κ r = 0, Theorem 1 also verifies that the mutual benefit exists in the ideal hardware case.</p><p>We note that the existence of mutual benefit in the ideal hardware case was also proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>,</p><p>where the assumption that c s (i) follows the complex Gaussian distribution and the approximation under high signal-noise-ratio (SNR) were adopted, however, in our work, we have not made any special assumptions on the distribution of c s (i) and also not used any approximations.

RATE MAXIMIZATION</head><p>In this section, we solve two optimization problems to maximize the weighted sum rate of all links for a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network with a single AmBC link or with multiple AmBC links, respectively, while considering HIs. Different from the sum rate, the weighted sum rate not only considers the total transmission rate of the primary link and the AmBC link, but also allows for different priorities in allocating wireless resources to the primary link and the AmBC link. Particularly, when the weight factor for each link is the same, the weighted sum rate reduces the sum rate.</p></div>

Multiple AmBC Links</head><p>In this subsection, we consider a mutualistic cooperative AmBC network with multiple BDs and formulate a problem to jointly optimize the time allocation, the transmit power of PT, and the power reflection coefficient so as to maximize the sum of weighted rate of the considered network. Subsequently we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the formulated problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Problem Formulation and Analysis:</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">2</ref>, the considered network is composed of one PT, one PR, and K BDs. In order to avoid the co-channel among BDs, the duration of an entire transmission is divided into K subslots and a TDMA scheme is adopted for BDs, where in one subslot, only one BD is allowed to backscatter its information to the PR while the other BDs operate in the energy harvesting mode. In other words, for the subslot t k , k = 1, 2, ..., K, the k-th BD works in the backscatter mode while the other BDs harvest energy from the PT's signal. Accordingly, based on the results of Section II-B, for t k , the rate of the primary link and the k-th AmBC link can be written as, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">C t k p = t k E c k s (i)   B w log 2   1 + P 0 h k β k g k c k s (i) 2 + P 0 f P 0 h k β k g k |c k s (i)| 2 + f κ + σ 2     ,<label>(21)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_37">C t k s = B w t k L log 2 1 + Lβ k h k g k P 0 P 0 (β k h k g k + f ) κ + σ 2 ,<label>(22)</label></formula><p>where h k , g k , and β k are the channel power gains of the k-th BD-PT link, the k-th BD-PR link (also termed as k-th AmBC link), and the power reflection coefficient of the k-th BD within t k , respectively.</p><p>For the k-th BD, the harvested energy in one transmission block can be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">E k BD = ϕ (1 -β k ) h k P 0 1 + κ 2 p t k + ϕ h k P 0 1 + κ 2 p K i=1,i =k t i .<label>(23)</label></formula><p>Accordingly, by considering the energy-causality constraint of each BD in each transmission block, the optimization problem to maximize the sum of weighted rate for the considered network with multiple BDs is formulated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">P 2 : max t k ,β k ,P 0 K k=1 θ k C t k s + 1 - K k=1 θ k K k=1 C t k p (24a) s.t.

In order to decouple these optimization variables and transform P 2 into a more tractable one, we first determine the optimal PT's transmit power P 0 . Similar to the proof of proposition 2, it is easy to obtain P * 0 = P max 0 1+κ 2 p . Thereby, P 2 is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">P 3 : max t k ,β k K k=1 θ k t k B w L log 2 1 + Lβ k h k g k P * 0 P * 0 (β k h k g k + f ) κ + σ 2 + 1 - K k=1 θ k × K k=1 t k E c k s (i)   B w log 2   1 + P * 0 h k β k g k c k s (i) 2 + P * 0 f P * 0 h k β k g k |c k s (i)| 2 + f κ + σ 2     (25a) s.t.

The non-convexity of P 3 arises from the objective function (25a) and the constraints (25c) and (25d). In particular, both the objective function and the left term of (25d) are non-convex, since they include coupled variables and the SINR is a typical nonlinear fractional term. If we consider an ideal hardware case for resource allocation, i.e., κ = 0, the SINR in the objective function would be affine. That is to say, to make the considered network more realistic, we need to devise an efficient approach to tackle the non-linear fractional term. Another difficulty is that t k and β k are coupled in the left term of (25c) and the non-linear energy harvesting model makes (25c) more complex and challenging.</p><p>In addition, due to the non-decreasing feature of the non-linear energy harvesting model, ϕ (•) is a quasi-concave function and its convexity cannot be determined in generally. Therefore, we have to face the difficulties in solving the optimization problems caused by the non-linear energy harvesting model.</p></div>

It is observed that constraint (26b) is linear and constraint (26d) can be proved to be convex by using similar ways in Proposition 4, while the convexity of constraint (26c) is still unclear due to the following reasons. First, t k is still coupled with ε k , which brings challenges in judging its convexity. Second, the convexity of ϕ (•), which depends on the specific non-linear energy harvesting model, is unclear and has a significant impact on the convexity of constraint (26c). In order to make constraint (26c) more tractable, the convexity-preserving property of a perspective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> is leveraged. Thus, the convexity of (26c) is the same as that of the following constraint, given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">ϕ (1 -ε k ) h k P * 0 1 + κ 2 p + ϕ h k P * 0 1 + κ 2 p K i=1,i =k t i ≥ P c t k , ∀k.<label>(27)</label></formula><p>Clearly, in constraint ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_50">27</ref>), all terms are linear except for ϕ (1 -ε k ) h k P * 0 1 + κ 2 p . Therefore, constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> is convex if and only if the non-linear energy harvesting model ϕ (•) is a concave function. Motivated by this observation, in this work, we consider the non-linear energy harvesting model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> as this model not only captures the nonlinear properties of a practical energy harvester, but also is a concave function with respect to the input power <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, making it more mathematically tractable than the other existing non-linear energy harvesting models considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.

On the contrary, ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">12</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> show that in the ideal hardware case, i.e., κ = κ p = κ r = 0, the rates of both links increase with the PT's transmit power without an upper bound. The above observations confirm that HIs will lead to a rate ceiling for both the primary and AmBC links. This is because the HIs introduce a distortion noise whose average power is proportional to the PT's transmit power, leading to an upper-bound SINR for decoding the primary and AmBC signals, as expected in ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">6</ref>) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> illustrates the impacts of the HI levels on the PT link's rate. Here we set the values of κ r and κ p are the same and vary from 0 to 0.2. The reason to consider a small value for HI parameters is that the 3GPP has suggested the range of the HI level from 0.08 to 0.175 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. One observation is that the simulation results with the BD's cooperation (marked by 'o') always match well with the theoretical results via <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, indicating the correctness of theoretical derivations. Another observation is that the scope of the primary link's rate decreases first and then increase under the Non-cooperation or the Cooperation. This is because the primary link's 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.2 r = p 3.5 rate 5 is a non-convex with respect with respect to κ r or κ p . Besides, we can see that the PT link's rate with/without the BD's cooperation decrease when the HI levels increase, since the existence of the HIs degrades the achievable rate at the PT and the larger the HI levels are, the smaller the PT link's rate is. Also, the rate gain from BD's cooperation always exists no matter what the HI level is and a larger HI level brings a smaller rate gain.</p></div>

This is because with the increase of HI levels, the power of the distortion noise increases and thus this reduces the PT link's rate and the BD's rate. Besides, compared to the fixed scheme, where the PT's transmit power equals the optimal one while all the power reflection coefficients are fixed instead of the optimal value, we can also see that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher rate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we have studied the impacts of HIs and the weighted sum-rate maximization problem in the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network. We have proven that under HIs, the rates of both primary and AmBC links decrease and there exist rate ceilings for both the primary and AmBC links. We have validated that the HIs do not destroy the mutualism relationship between the AmBC link and the primary link, and have also derived closed-form expressions for both the primary and AmBC links under the assumption that the BD's message follows a symmetric complex Gaussian distribution. Two resource allocation schemes have been proposed to maximize the weighted sum rate of all links for the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network with a single AmBC link or with multiple AmBC links, respectively. In particular, the optimal solutions to the single AmBC link were derived in the closed form, while the optimal solutions to the multiple AmBC links were obtained by using convex tools to solve an equivalent convex problem. Simulation results have validated our derived results and shown that our proposed schemes achieve a higher weighted sum rate than the benchmark schemes.</p></div>
